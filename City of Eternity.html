                <h1>Build projects - City of Eternity</h1>
                <img class="projimg" src="images/CityOfEternityCover.png">
                <p>The City of Eternity is maybe my most ambitious project ever. 
                    Never before have I taken on such a big project which requires tons upon tons of work and tens of thousands of blocks for just the outer wall alone!! 
                    For this project I build my own interpretation of the Imperial City from The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion. 
                    Before I started buidling in survival I had a lot of preperation work. 
                    First, I determined the sizes of all the circles and made sure that they look good in relation to the rest of the build.
                    I also made sure that the buildings have the right size and look realistic to live in. 
                    Then I create a sketch of the city in creative to see if it looks okay. 
                    It took a few tries and edits with changing the sizes of the circles, but after a while I had created a usable blueprint.</p>
                    
                <p>The entire process of building the city has taken about 1.5 years with some long breaks inbetween. 
                    I have documented the process by the use of minecraft maps which are displayed below.</p>

                <h2>Districts</h2>
                <p>The main part of the city consists of 6 disctricts in a circle and a 7th district in the center. 
                    Besides those districts there are also 3 more districts located outside of the main city area. 
                    An illustration of where which district lies can be seen below in a mapart created for the city.</p>

                <h3>Plaza district</h3>
                <p>The Plaza district is the first place one sees when entering the city though the main gate. 
                    It is full of houses both small and large which houses a variety of people. 
                    There are 2 big mansions in this district. 
                    One is owned by a rich collector who turned his mansion into a display of the history of the city and surroundings. 
                    The other mansion is owned by a rich buisiness man. 
                    In the center of the Plaza district there is a small plaza with a statue of the founder of the city greeting everyone who enters the city. 
                    The most important houses also have their entrances at the place to get a sense of community.</p>

                <h3>Prison district</h3>
                <p>The Prison disctrict is to this day still an active prison where inmates pay for their crimes.
                    As a visitor you can see the mechanisms behind the security of the prison and with a bit of luck maybe even some real prisoners.</p>
                <p>There is a rumor about the prison district which is as old as the prison itself. 
                    Hundrets of years ago a prisoner known by the name of "The Red Fox" was kept in a maximum security prisoncel.
                    She was known for leading the biggist criminal organisation of the century and only due to a very clever detective work they were able to track her down.
                    However, only 5 days after which she had been put in prison, she disappeared.
                    None of the guards present had seen her or noticed a thing, the main gate and all doors leading to the cells were still locked.
                    There was no possible way she could have escaped, however she was nowhere to be found.
                    Not long after rumors started surfacing about the old ruins beneath the prison.
                    That she must have found a way to access them and escape though them.
                    However, nothing was ever confirmed and she was never found again.</p>

                <h3>University district</h3>
                <p>The University district is home to a worldclass university in the magical arts. 
                    The university is known as the Arcane University.
                    People wishing to visit the university are only allowed to access the front area.
                    Only students with the proper recomendations are allowed on the campus grounds.
                    However, even the front area is still a sight to behold and worth the visit.
                    The university is as old as the acient core of the city and was build on a specific place with a high magical intensity.
                    Why the magical intensity is high there is unknown, but it most likey has to do with the previous inhabitants of the city.</p>

                <h2>History of the city</h2>
                <p>The city has a long and complicated history. It all began more then 1500 years ago. </p>
                <p>From archilogical excavations it has been determined that the city has been founded aproximatly 1506 years ago.
                    The city then looked quite different from the current view many of the buildings which were present then were destroyed or altered long ago.
                    The first inhabitants of the city had a quite unique relation with magic.
                    It is unknown how or why this relation was present but it left quite a mark on the design of the city.
                    The palace for example is full of magic energy with an unkown origin.
                    A recent exploration of an acient part of the sewer system revealed that there is another set of tunnels and hallways deep below the city.
                    Atempts to enter this area were unsuccesfull posibly due to magical bariers put in place.</p>
                <p>The first inhabitants lived in the city for over 400 years.
                    However, in some odd event over a thoudsand years ago all people seemed to have disappeared in a blink. 
                    All known records tell about the city suddenly being completely abandoned overnight.
                    People who tried to enter the city suddenly got a feeling of dreath and felt a pain on their chest which increased the closer they got to the palace.
                    Because of this many people at the time assumed something terrible must be located at the city and nobody set foot there in over 500 years.</p>
                <p>After that period of time, about 569 years ago, a group of people decided to explore the city. 
                    When they arrived the place had not been visited by anyone in over 500 years.
                    However, surprisingly enough, most buildings were completely intact and just overgrown.
                    They explored the city and found nothing strange at all, a no feelings of dreath or pain.
                    So, they decided to let their villages come over and settle there to start their new lives.
                    It did not take long or the city started to be a place of the living again and started to prospor.
                    Those brave men are the very reason the city is now the way it is and the reason you are able to come visit.</p>
                <p>If you are brave enough and want to visit the old parts of the city, then the ruins of ... might be of interest to you.
                    The ruins of ... are located just outside the city and can be accessed through a path located near the stables.
                    I do want to warn you, because of more then a thousand years of sea influence the ruins are partly submerged.
                    You are strongly advised to not step into the water while dangerous animals may live there and the part of the ruin which is under water is severely damaged and has a high risk of collapse.</p>

                <p>Beneath the entire city is an eleborate network of sewers. 
                    If you wish to explore these sewers please buy a sewer map to decrease the chance of you getting lost in there.
                    However, the sewers are definetly worth a visit while they are one in a kind.
                    Just make sure to stay clear from the sewers beneath the arena due to the possibility of vampiric activity.</p>
