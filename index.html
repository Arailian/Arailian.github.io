                <h1>Welcome to my minecraft blog</h1>
                <p>On this blog I will show the projects I have been working on and the progress of those projects.</p>
                <p>The projects are devided between build projects and restone projects. Currently I have focussed on build projects which means the redstone page is still empty.</p>
                <p>Each project will be supplied by images/video of the process and a detailed description of what it is and where it is located.</p>
                <p>If you want to know more about me or come into contact with me you can head over to the about page.</p>
