                <p>I am a minecrafter who goes by the name of ThatArailianGuy. I am part of a Minecraft Bedrock realm with a few other people where we have a nice and lovely community.</p>
                <p>I have been playing minecraft for about 6 to 7 years now. I started with Pocket Edition and about 2 years ago bought Windows 10 edition. I also tried Java, however prefer the bedrock mechanics and especially multiplayer options a lot more.</p>
                <p>If you want to know more about me or come in contact with me you can send me a message on Discord: Arailian#8218</p>
